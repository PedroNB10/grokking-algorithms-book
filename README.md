# Grokking Algorithms - Study Repository

A personal study repository containing implementations and notes from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. This repository includes practical algorithm implementations in Python and C++, along with detailed notes and exercises for each chapter.

## 📚 About

This repository documents my journey through "Grokking Algorithms," a beginner-friendly guide to understanding algorithms and data structures. Each chapter contains:

- **Markdown notes** with key concepts and explanations
- **Working code implementations** demonstrating the algorithms
- **Exercise solutions** from the book

## 📖 Contents

The repository is organized into chapters, each covering fundamental algorithms and data structures concepts. Implementations progress from basic search and sorting algorithms through more advanced topics like recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies.

## 🚀 Running the Code

All Python scripts can be run directly:
```bash
python chapter-XX/script_name.py
```

C++ files need to be compiled first:
```bash
g++ chapter-04/quicksort.cpp -o quicksort
./quicksort
```

## 📝 Notes

- Code includes type hints and comments for clarity
- Some scripts include interactive demonstrations
- Implementations focus on readability and understanding over optimization
